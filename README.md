# TYPESCRIPT DEMO

This repo is created to demonstrate the use of TypeScript.  All files in this repo with the file extension `.ts` or `.tsx` are designated TypeScript files, and where the focus is for this repo.


### What is TypeScript?

[Typescript](www.typescriptlang.org) is a superset of JavaScript--it extends the functionality of vanilla JavaScript by allowing to statically type variables as well as to use future ECMAScript syntax (though if you prefer to have a larger library for future ECMAScript syntax, I would suggest looking into [Babel](https://babeljs.io)).  I like using TypeScript for a few different reasons:
  - Statically typing variables can catch bugs earlier on, before you even try to execute the code in a browser
  - In my code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), as well as others which you can add plugins to, it allows for better IntelliSense while coding, as it remembers properties of objects better
  - On top of that, you can download type definitions for many popular frameworks (e.g. Angular, jQuery, Node) to make the IntelliSense available for use with those frameworks
  - It supports using JSX syntax (hence the `.tsx` files), which makes working with html elements in JavaScript for frameworks like React a lot easier
  - It can transpile to any version of ECMAScript
